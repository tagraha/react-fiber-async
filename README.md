# react-fiber-async
this repo's not ready for production. there's a lot of missing feature for that, ex: react helmet, env_example, code splitting etc. the reason I created this repo was for research purpose. 

The popular front end stack today is changing fast with React, react-router and webpack releasing newer versions. This is a starter app aimed to demonstrate how to integrate `babel`, `react@16`,`react-router@4` and `webpack@3`.
